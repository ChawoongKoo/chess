# chess
I made this chess ai bot during the summer after my college graduation. 
I was really bored and wanted something fun to do that could distract me from other work.
I hope I end up finishing it.

Created using lichess-bot:
Pantidis, I., Harrison, M., Choksi, S., & Duplessis, T. lichess-bot [Computer software]. https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot
